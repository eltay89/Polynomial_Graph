# Polynomial_Graph
Polynomial Graphing Calculator

Description: A Python program that allows users to input a polynomial equation and visualize its graph using Matplotlib. The program uses a graphical user interface built with Tkinter to make it easy to input the equation and set the x and y axis ranges. Users can input any polynomial equation of degree up to 9 and see its graph displayed instantly. 

E.g. To draw the graph of x^2 using the code I provided, you would enter "1 0 0" in the polynomial equation text box. This represents the polynomial x^2, where the coefficient of x^2 is 1, the coefficient of x is 0, and the constant term is also 0.
